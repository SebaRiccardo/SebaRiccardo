👋 Hello, my name is Sebastian, and I am a Computer Science Engineer with a strong focus on web and mobile application development, primarily on the backend. I am committed to continuous learning and actively expanding my skills in areas such as frontend development and DevOps.

🌐 As a native Spanish speaker, some of my repositories are written in Spanish. I welcome collaboration and contributions — including translations — from developers around the world.
