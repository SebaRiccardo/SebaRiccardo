- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Sebastian and I'm a Computer Science Engineer. My main interests are web and mobile development (mainly backend) but things change often so, I'm constantly learning new things like frontend and some devops as well ğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ.
- Since I'm not a native English speaker, some of my repos are in Spanish so feel free to collab and translate them.
